# ServerKit Redesign Map

> Status: **planning** · Owner: Juan · Source design: clickable prototype (`ServerKit.zip` →
> `serverkit/view_*.jsx` + `styles.css`) · Target: the live modular app under `frontend/src` + `backend/app`.

This is the working map for adopting the new ServerKit design across the app. It was built by comparing
**every prototype view** against its **current production page** (22 view-groups analyzed). Read §0–§1 first;
they set the thesis and the rules. §4 is the per-page checklist. §5 is the backend work. §6 is the decisions
that are yours to make.

---

## 0. What this redesign actually is

**It is a front-end re-skin + information-architecture (IA) overhaul — not a feature build.**

The prototype is a *standalone clickable mockup* (React via CDN + Babel, mock `window.DATA`). The live app
**already implements ~90% of what it shows** at the backend (62 API blueprints, 100+ services, 60+ models) and
mostly at the frontend too (45+ pages). So for most views the work is: **restyle the existing page into the new
visual language, reshuffle its IA, and slot the result into the existing modular structure** — *not* a rewrite.

A recurring trap: **the prototype is frequently a _subset_ of the live app** (Servers, Docker, Files, Git,
Security, Email all show *less* than we already ship). Taking it literally would delete working capabilities
(tabs, filters, bulk actions, file browsers, webhook management, agent fleet rails). The rule is **restyle +
selectively borrow IA, re-home what the mockup omits, never silently drop a working feature.**

---

## 1. The modularity contract (golden rules)

These keep the redesign inside the structure you already like:

1. **Remap token _values_ behind existing token _names_.** The new palette (periwinkle accent `#6d7cff`,
   3-tier surface ramp, 4-tier text, new `cyan`/`violet` semantics, `*-bg` washes) lands in
   `styles/_theme-variables.scss` + `styles/_variables.scss` by **changing values**, not renaming. Every page's
   SCSS reads `$bg-*/$text-*/$accent-*` today — a repo-wide rename is the one thing that would break everything.
   Add genuinely new tokens (`--cyan`, `--violet`, `--accent-bright`) **additively**. Keep light-theme overrides
   and the `*-raw` values used by SCSS `fade()` in sync.
2. **One feature = one page + one SCSS partial + one API module.** Restyling a page touches
   `pages/X.jsx` and `styles/pages/_x.scss` (and its `services/api/x.js` only if a new endpoint is added).
   Don't fork a new architecture.
3. **Build shared primitives once (§3), then consume them everywhere.** No per-page bespoke pills/charts/tables.
4. **Preserve the superset.** When the mockup shows fewer tabs/controls than today, re-home the missing ones
   (a drawer section, a settings sub-route, a secondary surface) — don't delete them.
5. **Keep deep-linking working.** Tabs are wired through `useTabParam`/`VALID_TABS`. If you change a tab set,
   update `VALID_TABS` and add redirects for old `?tab=` values.
6. **Bind to real `api.*`.** Drop all `window.DATA` mock wiring from the prototype; it is throwaway.
7. **One logical change per commit**, focused diffs, branch prefixes (`feature/redesign-*`).

---

## 2. Phase 0 — Design System & Chrome foundation (do this first)

Everything else depends on this. Effort: **L**. **Status: ✅ done (2026-06-07)** — tokens remapped
(dark/light/system) + prototype tokens added; IBM Plex self-hosted; accent ramp runtime-derived in
`ThemeContext`; shared primitives built in `components/ds/`; sidebar restyled (gradient rail, mono section
headers, left accent bar, dimmed icons, restyled footer/user-menu, 250px). SCSS compiles, ESLint 0 errors.
Git stays **plugin-owned** under Infrastructure (no core duplicate — avoids a dead link when the plugin is off).

- **Fonts** → IBM Plex Sans + IBM Plex Mono, **self-hosted** (OFL-licensed `.woff2` vendored in
  `frontend/public/fonts/` via `frontend/scripts/fetch-fonts.mjs`, declared in `styles/base/_fonts.scss`).
  **No Google Fonts / third-party CDN** — a self-hosted control panel must not leak every visitor's IP + usage
  to Google, and self-hosting also works on air-gapped/offline installs. `$font-main`/`$font-mono` retargeted in
  `_variables.scss`; `system-ui` fallback keeps the app working if the woff2 files are absent.
- **Tokens** → remap in `_theme-variables.scss`/`_variables.scss` per rule §1.1: surface ramp
  (`--surface`/`-2`/`-3` + near-black bg), 4-tier text (`--text`/`-dim`/`-faint`/`-ghost`), accent
  `#6d7cff` + `--accent-bright`/`--accent-dim`/`--accent-bg`/`--accent-glow`, **new** `--cyan`/`--violet`
  (+ `-bg`), radius scale (10/7/14), shadow scale, and the `.app` radial accent wash.
- **Sidebar** (`styles/layout/_sidebar.scss` + `components/Sidebar.jsx` + `components/sidebarItems.js`):
  gradient bg, 34px gradient logo tile, mono-uppercase section headers, left accent bar + glow on active item,
  optional per-item **badge dot** slot. Add a top-level **Git** item under Infrastructure; align preset
  membership to the prototype (Full / Web Hosting / Email Admin / Docker-DevOps / Minimal).
  **Keep** the current richer structure: collapsible sub-items, `WorkspaceSwitcher`, plugin-nav injection,
  dev-tools group. (Preset persistence via `sidebar_config`, theme/accent via `ThemeContext` localStorage —
  both already exist; verify the dark/light/**system** trio.)

---

## 3. Shared component library (build once → reused everywhere)

These recur across nearly every view. Build them in `components/ui/` (or `components/common/`) with styles in
new partials (`styles/components/_charts.scss`, `_datatable.scss`, `_drawer.scss`, `_kpi.scss`). **This is the
highest-leverage work in the whole redesign** — most page tasks become trivial once these exist.

| Primitive | New / Reuse | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pill / StatusPill** | NEW | ~all | dot + label, kinds green/amber/red/gray/cyan. Replaces ad-hoc `Badge`/bespoke pills. |
| **EnvTag** | NEW | wp, services, dashboard, workspaces | PROD / DEV / STAGING / SERVICE colored tag. |
| **SegControl** | NEW | dashboard, monitoring, backups, services, security, appearance, filters | segmented toggle; replaces native `<select>`/`filter-chip`. |
| **KPI / MetricCard** | NEW | dashboard, domains, docker, git, cron, monitoring, services, wp, email, security, workspaces | icon chip + value + trend + sub. |
| **AreaChart** | NEW (consolidate `MetricsGraph`) | dashboard, servers, services, wp, monitoring, email | multi-series smooth area, gradient fill, **theme-token colors** (move hard-coded hex out). |
| **Sparkline** | NEW | kpi strips, monitors table | tiny inline polyline. |
| **DataTable (`.dtable`)** | NEW shared style | wp-list, servers, docker, databases, domains, services, cron, backups, security, email, settings | dense table; `cell-name`/`cell-mono`/`kind-ico`; selectable + bulk-toolbar variant. |
| **Ckbox (tri-state)** | NEW | selectable tables (wp-list first) | header select-all + per-row. |
| **Drawer + Scrim** | NEW — **build on existing `components/ui/sheet.jsx`** | domains, backups (restore), cron, git (repo), services (peek), infra (SSH/logs) | right slide-over; **unifies ~4 divergent drawers today** (logs-drawer bottom-dock, dx-inspector, preview-drawer, ai-drawer). |
| **svc-tile** (gradient initial avatar) | NEW | wp, services, workspaces, marketplace, db | first-letter tile, hue hashed from name (`svcGrad`). |
| **gauge** (inline mini bar) | NEW | servers, docker, services, email, wp(db), domains | thin threshold-colored fill (red>75 / amber>50). |
| **ScoreGauge** (SVG ring) | NEW | security overview, wp security posture, email reputation | donut + score/label. |
| **Heatmap** (contribution grid) | NEW | backups overview | 18-week daily intensity. |
| **feed-item** (activity feed) | NEW | dashboard, wp, security, backups, git, services | colored dot + html text + time. |
| **Switch** | **REUSE** `components/ui/switch.jsx` | settings, security, schedules, toggles | restyle to gradient-on. |
| **Icon** | **REUSE** `lucide-react` | all | do **not** add the prototype's parallel icon registry; map names. |

## 4. Per-page change map

Effort: S/M/L/XL. Nature: **Restyle** (look only) · **+IA** (layout/tab/route reshuffle) · **+BE** (needs new backend to be fully real).
"Update" = existing files to restyle. "Create" = genuinely new files. All paths under `frontend/src` unless noted.

| # | View | Effort | Nature | Update | Create | Backend gap (→ §5) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Design system + chrome** | L | Restyle+IA | `_variables.scss`, `_theme-variables.scss`, `layout/_sidebar.scss`, `Sidebar.jsx`, `sidebarItems.js`, `index.html` | shared primitives (§3) | none (badge data minor) |
| 1 | **Dashboard** | M | Restyle+IA | `pages/Dashboard.jsx`, `MetricsGraph.jsx`, `pages/_dashboard.scss` | ServerSwitcher, ActivityFeed | activity-feed source (maybe) | **✅ pass 1 done** — metric tiles → `MetricCard`, apps status → `Pill`, chart retinted to new palette (kept the real `MetricsGraph` intact), dotsep meta. Deferred: server-switcher dropdown + activity feed. |
| 2 | **Servers list + detail** | L | Restyle+IA | `pages/Servers.jsx`, `pages/ServerDetail.jsx`, `pages/_servers.scss` | — (reuse MetricsGraph) | reboot cmd, per-server SSH launch; region/load = mock-only | **✅ top-bar migrated** — built shared `SERVER_TABS`; `PageTopbar` (Servers/Agent Fleet/Fleet Monitor/Cloud/Config Templates) added to all 5 pages; **sidebar sub-menu removed**. Main Servers page: top bar added ABOVE the ops workspace — **fleet rail / groups / workbar / bulk / pairing fully preserved** (no over-trim). Sub-page headers swapped to PageTopbar (actions kept). **Follow-up:** restyle the Servers LIST to the demo's dense table (Host/Region/CPU/Memory/Apps/Load) + ServerDetail tabs — bodies still old-look. |
| 3 | **WordPress list** | L | Restyle+IA+BE | `pages/WordPress.jsx`, `pages/_wordpress.scss` | DataTable usage | enrich `get_sites` payload (plugins/updates/visits/uptime/server/php/env); optional bulk route |
| 4 | **WordPress detail (tabbed)** | **XL** | Restyle+IA+BE | `pages/WordPressDetail.jsx` (owns all 14 tabs), `pages/_wordpress.scss`, `_applications.scss` | header env-switcher, FilesDrawer/code-viewer, StatCard/gauge/bar-h | DB largest-tables, OPcache/extensions, uptime response-time + 90d, analytics referrers/devices, posture score |
| 5 | **Docker** | M | Restyle | `pages/Docker.jsx`, `pages/_docker.scss` | KPI tiles | none (strict subset of current) | **✅ pass 1 done** — added `MetricCard` KPI strip (Containers/Images/Volumes/Networks from existing `stats`) atop `dx-main`, restyled status filter → segmented control. KEPT the richer dx- rail/5-tabs/inspector/exec/multi-server. Deferred: per-container accent dot, Projects KPI, logs modal→drawer. |
| 6 | **Database Explorer** | M | Restyle | `pages/Databases.jsx`, `databases/ConsoleTab.jsx`, `SourceTree.jsx`, `ResultsGrid.jsx`, `pages/_databases.scss` | syntax-highlight/gutter editor wrapper | optional "Export as SQL" dump | **✅ pass 1 done** — page already matched the target shell (token-aligned in Phase 0); added engine status-dot glow, green result count, `UTF-8` + `● Connected` status-bar segments. Deferred: syntax-highlight editor + gutter, `+` new-tab pill, ctx-menu Browse-rows/Export-SQL, semantic cell tints. |
| 7 | **File Manager** | M | Restyle+IA | `pages/FileManager.jsx`, `file-manager/FolderTree.jsx`, `PreviewDrawer.jsx`, `ContextMenu.jsx`, `pages/_file-manager.scss` | `file-manager/highlight.js` | cloud/S3 sources = **out of scope** | **✅ top-bar migrated** — shared `FILE_TABS` (Files/FTP Server); `PageTopbar` on both pages (FileManager top bar above its fullscreen browser; FTP header swapped, conditional actions kept); **sidebar sub-menu removed**. **Follow-up:** restyle the FileManager body (storage-sources tree, syntax-highlight preview) + FTP body. |
| 8 | **Domains** | L | Restyle+IA+BE | `pages/Domains.jsx`, `pages/_domains.scss` | DomainDrawer (SSL/registration/DNSSEC/NS + inline DNS records) | registrar, registration-expiry, DNSSEC, nameservers, registration auto-renew, status (WHOIS) | **✅ migrated (first top-bar page)** — built shared **`PageTopbar`** ds primitive; Domains now uses the demo's top-bar layout with routed sub-nav (Domains/DNS Zones/SSL) replacing the **removed sidebar sub-menu**; KPI strip + segmented filter + `.sk-dtable` + detail **Drawer**. Omitted unbacked columns (registrar/DNSSEC/nameservers — no WHOIS backend). **Trio complete:** DNSZones + SSLCertificates pages now render the same `PageTopbar` (shared `DOMAIN_TABS`), so the Domains/DNS/SSL tab group persists across all three. DNS/SSL page *bodies* are not yet fully restyled (their lists/forms still old-look) — a later pass. |
| 9 | **Monitoring** | **XL** | Restyle+IA+BE | `pages/Monitoring.jsx`, `pages/_monitoring.scss` | `services/api/monitoring.js`, monitors/status/incidents subviews | synthetic monitors (HTTP/Ping/Port/Keyword); **status pages + incidents already have backend** — wire in; request-volume/p50-p95 per-app likely gap | **✅ top-bar migrated** — shared `MONITOR_TABS` (Monitoring/Status Pages); `PageTopbar` on both pages; **sidebar sub-menu removed** (Refresh + Start/Stop and Create-Page actions preserved). Body restyle (KPI/charts/monitors/incidents) still pending. |
| 10 | **Backups** | **XL** | Restyle+IA+BE | `pages/Backups.jsx`, `pages/_backups.scss` | RestoreDrawer, Heatmap | activity timeseries, GFS retention, multi-destination storage, selective/clone restore, per-snapshot duration/progress |
| 11 | **Git** | L | Restyle+IA+BE | `pages/Git.jsx`, `pages/_git.scss`, `services/api/files.js` | RepoDeployDrawer | provider OAuth connect/disconnect + provider list; Gitea storage/users/runners metrics |
| 12 | **Terminal / Logs** | L | Restyle+IA | `pages/Terminal.jsx`, `pages/_terminal.scss` | console/TargetRail, TerminalPane, LogsPane (delegate to existing consoles) | unified targets endpoint; live streaming for non-file targets |
| 13 | **Services (list/new/detail)** | L | Restyle+IA+BE | `pages/Services.jsx`, `NewService.jsx`, `ServiceDetail.jsx`, `service-detail/OverviewTab.jsx`, `MetricsTab.jsx`, 3 partials | TemplateCatalog, area charts | per-service metrics history + requests/min; template-catalog source; image/scratch create paths | **✅ top-bar migrated** — shared `SERVICE_TABS` (Services/New Service/Templates/Deploy Activity); `PageTopbar` on all 4 group pages; **sidebar sub-menu removed**. NewService breadcrumb folded into the active tab; Templates search + Deployments live/refresh actions preserved. **NewService method-card chooser restyled** to the demo's centered cards (GitHub OAuth + manifest flows kept). **Follow-up:** template-catalog grid + Docker-Image/From-Scratch methods (backend gap), Services dense table, ServiceDetail tabs. |
| 14 | **Cron Jobs** | L | Restyle+IA+BE | `pages/CronJobs.jsx`, `pages/_cron.scss`, `services/api/system.js` | CronDrawer | run history, next-run, success-rate, job target metadata |
| 15 | **Security (suite)** | L | Restyle+IA+BE | `pages/Security.jsx`, all `components/security/*Tab.jsx`, `pages/_security.scss`, `services/api/security.js` | ScoreGauge usage | geo-blocking, policy toggles, scan schedules, security sessions, pending-update list, integrity verify/revert. **fail2ban + SSH-keys already exist** (minor missing fields) |
| 16 | **Workspaces (list + detail)** | L | Restyle+IA+BE | `pages/Workspaces.jsx`, `pages/_workspaces.scss`, `services/api/servers.js` | **`pages/WorkspaceDetail.jsx`** + `/workspaces/:id` route | **plan/billing**, aggregated CPU/Mem/Storage usage, service/site counts, member `last_active` |
| 17 | **Marketplace** | M | Restyle+IA | `pages/Marketplace.jsx`, `pages/_marketplace.scss` | — | 3rd-party integration connect (OAuth) + "core" flag | **✅ pass 1 done** — SCSS-only: hero/section kickers → mono eyebrow, card hover shadow → token, category filter active → accent chip (cards already had hover-lift + tinted tiles). PRESERVED tabs + plugin-install-from-source + side panel (no regression). **Also top-bar migrated:** shared `MARKET_TABS` (Marketplace/Downloads); `PageTopbar` replaced the hero; **sidebar sub-menu removed** (Import ZIP action kept). Deferred: single-scroll IA + 3rd-party integrations (needs OAuth backend). |
| 18 | **Email Server** | L | Restyle+IA+BE | `pages/Email.jsx`, `pages/_email.scss`, `services/api/system.js` | KPI/gauge/reputation-ring | mail-volume timeseries, reputation/RBL, structured activity feed, real mailbox storage, per-item retry |
| 19 | **Workflow Builder** | M | Restyle+IA | `pages/WorkflowBuilder.jsx`, `pages/_workflow.scss` | wf-rail / wf-head regions (reuse ReactFlow nodes) | workflow-level active/paused flag (likely) |
| 20 | **Settings** | L | Restyle | `pages/Settings.jsx` (IA already matches!), all `components/settings/*Tab.jsx`, `pages/_settings.scss` | — | **active-session list + revoke** (JWT JTI registry) — only real gap | **✅ pass 1 done** — nav group labels → mono eyebrow, toggles → gradient-on (reskins all 17 tabs), theme-preview swatches repainted to new palette. Deferred: per-tab `.dtable`/Active-Sessions. |
| 21 | **Infra overlays (SSH + log drawers)** | M | Restyle+IA | `components/RemoteTerminal.jsx`, `LogsDrawer.jsx`, `wordpress/ContainerLogs.jsx`, `_logs-drawer.scss` | `styles/components/_drawer.scss` | structured `{ts,level,msg}` log payloads (optional; can parse client-side) |

### Notes on the nuanced ones
- **WP detail (#4):** the single biggest task — 14 tabs. The prototype merges some into a **Security hub**
  (Posture/Vulns/Updates) and a **Settings hub** (General/PHP/Git/Uptime/Reports), and turns Files/Logs into
  **drawers**. Adopting hubs changes `VALID_TABS` deep-linking → see decision §6. Recommended: keep tabs flat,
  restyle in place, add the header env-switcher + Files drawer.
- **Monitoring (#9) / Backups (#10):** these read as a *different, larger product surface* than today's
  resource-threshold monitor / CRUD backup page. Treating them as pure restyle would silently drop Alert
  Rules / Delivery / History (monitoring) and Settings/retention (backups). Several regions are net-new backend.
  Sequence these **last** and decide build-vs-stub (§6).
- **Servers (#2), Docker (#5), Files (#7), Git (#11), Security (#15), Email (#18):** prototype is a subset.
  Keep the agent-fleet rail / 5 docker tabs+inspector+exec / file type-filters+disk-mounts / git webhooks+deploy
  history+file browser / security audit tab / email aliases+forwarding+per-service controls. Re-home, don't drop.

---

## 5. Backend gap register

Most of the redesign needs **no backend work**. These are the genuine gaps — each is "build it" only if you want
that surface to be *live* rather than stubbed. Recommended default: **restyle first with the data we have, ship
net-new backend behind the new UI in follow-ups.**

**Net-new concepts (largest):**
- **Workspace plan/billing** — plan tier (Free/Starter/Team/Business), price, seats, invoices. No model today
  (only `billing_notes`). Plus aggregated per-workspace CPU/Mem/Storage usage, service/site counts, member `last_active`.
- **Monitoring** — synthetic uptime monitors (HTTP/Ping/Port/Keyword + scheduler + history + multi-region) and
  per-app request-volume / p50-p95. *Status pages + incidents + uptime already have backend* (`status_pages_bp`,
  `uptime_bp`, `StatusIncident`) — wire them into the new Monitoring IA rather than rebuild.
- **Backups** — activity timeseries/heatmap, GFS retention (daily/weekly/monthly), multiple named storage
  destinations, selective/clone restore + pre-restore safety snapshot, per-snapshot duration & live progress.

**Field/endpoint additions (medium):**
- **Cron** — persist run history + compute next-run + success-rate + job target metadata.
- **Security** — geo-blocking; policy toggles (enforce-2FA, auto-ban, block-on-critical-malware, login-alerts);
  scan schedules; security-scoped active sessions; pending-update package list; integrity verify/revert state.
- **Settings → Security** — active session listing + revoke (needs a JWT JTI/token registry).
- **Git** — provider OAuth connect/disconnect + provider list; Gitea storage/users/orgs/uptime/runners metrics.
- **Domains** — registrar, registration expiry, DNSSEC, nameservers, registration auto-renew, status (WHOIS-backed).
- **Services** — per-service metrics history (CPU/Mem/Net/Requests over ranges) + requests/min; real template
  catalog source; first-class Docker-image / from-scratch create paths.
- **WP detail** — DB largest-tables, OPcache + extensions toggles, uptime response-time + 90-day rollup,
  analytics referrers/devices, computed posture score.
- **Email** — mail-volume timeseries, sender reputation/RBL checks, structured delivery activity feed, real
  per-mailbox storage usage, per-message retry.
- **Marketplace** — third-party integration connect (OAuth/token store) + a `core` flag on catalog entries.
- **Workflow** — workflow-level active/paused enable flag (verify `updateWorkflow` doesn't already persist one).
- **WP list / Dashboard** — enriched `get_sites` list payload; an audit/activity events source for the feeds.
- **Console** — a unified "targets" aggregator endpoint; push-based live log streaming for non-file targets.

**Out of scope (recommend defer/skip):**
- File Manager **cloud/S3 "storage sources"** (current sources are panel host + remote agents).
- Server **region** and **load-average** columns (no field in the server model; presentational only).

---

## 6. Decisions that are yours to make

**Decided 2026-06-07:** (1) **Net-new backend = restyle-first, stub the rest** — reskin every page now with
existing data; render net-new regions with clearly-stubbed placeholders; build backend gaps in follow-ups.
(2) **Start = Phase 0 foundation.**
(3) **Infra pages adopt the demo's top-bar layout, NOT sidebar sub-menus.** In the demo, Servers/Domains/Services
have no expanded sidebar sub-tree — each page carries its own **top bar** (icon + title + spacer + actions), and
detail pages use breadcrumb + in-page tabs. So as each infra page is migrated, **remove its sidebar `subItems`**
(`sidebarItems.js`) and move that navigation into a page-level top bar / in-page nav. Build a reusable page
top-bar component (matching the demo's `.topbar`) when the first such page is migrated. The app keeps ALL its
extra capabilities (Agent Fleet, DNS Zones, SSL, FTP, Status Pages, etc.) — they move from the sidebar into the
page's top bar / sub-nav, they are NOT removed. **When Domains and Servers are migrated they should look almost
identical to the demo.**
(4) **Logo = the demo's gradient tile** (periwinkle gradient rounded-square + white server glyph). Applied to the
sidebar brand; `ServerKitLogo` (the detailed SVG mark) still appears on login/setup/about/mobile — propagate the
tile there only if desired.

Remaining IA forks (pick before the dependent page starts):

1. ~~**Net-new backend policy**~~ — **decided: restyle-first, stub the rest.**
2. **WP detail tabs** — keep 14 flat tabs (restyle in place, preserves deep-links) or adopt the Security/Settings **hubs**?
3. **Logs surface** — keep the current bottom-dock `LogsDrawer`, or move to the prototype's right-side drawer?
4. **Dashboard** — keep widget show/hide/reorder (`useDashboardLayout`) or the prototype's fixed 3-band layout?
5. **Marketplace** — keep the plugin-install-from-source UI (URL/folder/zip) as a secondary surface (recommended) or drop it?
6. **Workspace roles** — backend is `owner/admin/member/viewer`; prototype shows `Owner/Admin/Developer`. Map labels or rename?

---

## 7. Recommended sequencing

- **Phase 0 — Foundation:** §2 design system + chrome, and the §3 shared primitives. Nothing ships convincingly
  until these exist.
- **Phase 1 — Restyle-only wins (validate the system, no backend):** Settings (#20, IA already matches),
  Databases (#6), Docker (#5), Marketplace (#17), Dashboard (#1), Workflow (#19), infra drawers (#21).
- **Phase 2 — Restyle + IA (subset-preserving):** Servers (#2), WP list (#3), Services (#13), Git (#11),
  Terminal (#12), Cron (#14), Domains (#8), Email (#18), Security (#15), Workspaces list (#16).
- **Phase 3 — XL + backend-dependent:** WP detail (#4), Monitoring (#9), Backups (#10), Workspace detail +
  billing (#16). Gate each on the §6 decisions and §5 backend choices.

Each page is one (or a few) focused commit(s): restyle the page file + its SCSS partial, consume shared
primitives, add API methods only where a §5 gap is being filled.
