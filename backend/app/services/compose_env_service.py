"""Inject a managed app's effective environment into its Compose services.

Single-container apps get their env via ``docker run -e`` (see
``EnvService.get_effective_env`` + ``DeploymentService._deploy_docker``). Compose
apps instead get container env from the compose file's ``environment:`` block, so
to make shared variable groups + the app's own local env vars reach a compose
app's containers we write a **managed override compose file**
(``docker-compose.serverkit.yml``) next to the app's base compose. The override
adds an ``environment:`` overlay to every service; Docker Compose merges it on top
of the base (override wins on key collisions), so the effective env is
authoritative — matching the single-container behaviour.

This is non-destructive: ServerKit owns only the override file and never edits the
user's / template's base compose. The override is regenerated on every
``compose up`` / ``compose restart`` and removed when the app has no effective env,
so it never goes stale. Everything here is best-effort and guarded — a failure to
build the overlay must never block a deploy; the caller simply falls back to the
plain base compose.
