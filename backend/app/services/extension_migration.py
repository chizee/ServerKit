"""One-shot auto-install of converted builtin extensions (decision D3).

When a core page is converted into a builtin extension, an *upgraded* panel must
not lose the feature. On the first boot after such an upgrade we auto-install the
extension once, recording a per-slug marker so we never do it again — the user is
free to uninstall afterwards and it stays uninstalled.

Fresh installs are different: they never had the page as a core feature, so they
should discover the extension in the Marketplace rather than have it pre-installed
(flagships that ship installed-by-default per D4 are handled separately, not here).
We distinguish the two by whether any user exists yet — a brand-new panel has none
until the setup wizard creates the first admin.

The whole pass is best-effort: a failure to install (e.g. a Docker panel whose
frontend plugins dir isn't writable) is logged and retried on the next boot, and
never blocks startup. The builtin frontends are pre-bundled (D5) regardless, so
the marker only governs whether the contribution is switched on.
