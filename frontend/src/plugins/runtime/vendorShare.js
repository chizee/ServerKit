/**
 * Host vendor sharing for runtime-loaded extension bundles (plan 25 Decision 2).
 *
 * A runtime extension bundle externalizes the shared libraries (`react`,
 * `react-dom`, `react/jsx-runtime`, `react-router-dom`, `serverkit-sdk`) and
 * resolves them at load time through a static import map injected into
 * index.html (see vite.config.js `serverkitImportmap`). Each mapped URL points
 * at a small shim under `/serverkit-vendor/*.mjs` that re-exports from THIS
 * global — so the extension and the host share ONE instance of React et al.
 * (two React copies ⇒ "Invalid hook call" crash).
 *
 * Capturing the namespaces here (rather than letting the shim import the
 * package) is what guarantees the single instance: the host already bundled
 * these once; the shim just hands the extension the host's own objects.
 *
 * Imported first in main.jsx so the global is populated long before any
 * extension bundle is fetched (extensions load post-boot, after contributions).
