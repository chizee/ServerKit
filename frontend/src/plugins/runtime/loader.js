/**
 * Runtime extension frontend loader (plan 25 Phase 2, Decision 1).
 *
 * For an installed extension that ships a prebuilt ESM bundle, the panel:
 *   1. fetches the bundle through the JWT-authed assets route (raw bytes),
 *   2. verifies its sha256 against the hash recorded at install time
 *      (served in the /plugins/contributions `frontends` map),
 *   3. imports it via a Blob URL — resolving its externalized bare specifiers
 *      (react, react-dom, react/jsx-runtime, react-router-dom, serverkit-sdk)
 *      through the host import map to the panel's OWN singleton instances.
 *
 * Auth + integrity in one move, mirroring install-time pinning: on-disk tampering
 * after install is caught at every load. Fail soft, loudly (Decision 5): a bundle
 * that fails hash check or import records an error state and renders a failure card
 * on its routes — never a white screen, never silent absence.
 *
 * Baked builtins + dev keep the build-time glob path (Decision 4); this loader is
 * a no-op in dev (no import map there; dev resolves bare specifiers itself).
