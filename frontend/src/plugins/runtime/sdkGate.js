/**
 * Load-time SDK gate decision (plan 32 Decision 1) — the pure half of the
 * runtime loader's version check, split out so it's unit-testable under plain
 * node (the loader itself touches `import.meta.env` and `crypto`).
 *
 * A runtime frontend declares an `sdk_version` semver range it was built
 * against. The panel reports its own SDK version. Before fetching any bytes the
 * loader decides:
 *
 *   'load'   — range covers the panel's SDK (or the panel didn't report one).
 *   'grace'  — the extension pins no range: warn-and-load for one release,
 *              matching install-time's fail-open (`_assert_manifest_sdk_compatible`).
 *   'refuse' — the range excludes the panel's SDK; fail closed with an explain
 *              string on the failure card instead of a cryptic import error.
